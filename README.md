- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamflitney
- 👀 I’m interested in building exciting products using full stack web development with an emphasis on javascript and the front end, i'm also interested in Japanese and the Japanese culture!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Next.js in order to create a new version of my personal website with a CMS driven blog.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything javascript related or part of the javascript ecosystem (tooling, documentation, anything really)
- 📫 How to reach me - I'm pretty old fashioned so the best way is via email (adam . flitney at gmail . com) but I can also be found on twitter (@adamflitney)
